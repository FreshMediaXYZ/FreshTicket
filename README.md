FreshTicket is one of the many systems launched by the FreshMedia team. We want to offer our players the possibility to get support in an uncomplicated and fast way and to offer our customers an insight into the work of the FreshMedia team.

Some of the most important features:
* Lightning fast and simple ticket creation directly in the game.
* Discord notifications on ticket creation
* As a Patreon member you will get earlier access to the latest changes and more bonuses.
* You can now also apply on our Discord server as a supporter, moderator or developer! :smile: [NO LONGER AVAILABLE]

_You can find more information here:_ **LINK COMING SOON**

<!-- Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template! -->

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Here you will learn the most important steps how to use the FreshTicket system on your server.

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to make the following changes even before the installation.

<h3>Discord Webhook Creation</h3>

_Create a Discord Webhook before Installation._

Small Guide on how to create a webhook:

1. Open discord and change to the prefered Server.
2. Go to a text channel, which will receive the notifications.
3. Click on "Edit Channel" and switch to "Integrations".
4. Now under "Webhooks", press "View Webhooks >".
5. Create a new Webhook, with a desired Name and Profile Picture.
6. Do not forget to copy the Webhook URL.
**WARNING:** Do not share your webhook URL with third parties under any circumstances!

<h3>Discord Configuration Settings</h3>

_Change the Discord Configuration as you like_

In the Discord Configuration you can change any discord
related setting as you'd like to.
_It is intended to only be able to change
the images as a Patreon._

On top of the DCConfig.yml you can paste in the
webhook URL.

**Do not change any %parameters% .**

<h3>Minecraft Configuration Settings</h3>

_Change the Discord Configuration as you like_

In the Minecraft Configuration you can change any minecraft
related setting as you'd like to.
In here you change anything there is to
change without having to be a patreon.

**Do not change any %parameters% .**

### Installation

_Here you will learn briefly and concisely how to install and set up FreshTicket correctly._

1. Download the plugin from the official Spigot site. [(LINK COMING SOON)]
2. Put the downloaded .jar file into the plugins folder of your server.
3. Reload your server with /reload.
4. _Check if there is an error in the console._
5. With the command /ft you can check if the installation was successful.
6. In your plugins folder, the "FreshTicket" folder should now have been created.

_In this folder there are even more new files and folders._
_The file named "DCConfig.yml" is the center of your discord related
system and manages the most important discord settings._
_The file named "MCConfig.yml" is the center of your minecraft related
system and manages the most important minecraft settings._
_There you can customize everything as it is most convenient for you._
